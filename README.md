# Fe Concentrator Demo

This demo will deploy and end to end AI and Optimisation solution for an Iron Ore Concentrator. This demo will be deployed using Databricks Asset Bundles (DAB's). 

## Quick Start

## Workspace Setup

Firstly you will need to pull this Repo down into your Databricks Workspace as a Git Folder. 

1. **Clone Repo to Workspace**:
   - Workspace â†’ Create â†’ Git Folder
   - Paste in the Repo https location
   - click "Create"

2. **Deploy via DABS in the UI**:
   - **Edit DABs Config**- Open the file `databricks.yml` from the root of the git repo
   - In the `databricks.yml` file, you will need to enter your `Catalog` name and desired `Warehouse` name as shown:

## What Gets Deployed

- **Workflow**: `deploy-iops-demo-workflow` This is a workflow to deploy the models, run ingestion pipelines and deploy our Databricks App 
- **Notebooks**: `notebooks/mining-iron-ore-processing/` â†’ this director contains the main Demo notebooks and links to Demo content/objects
- **Dashboard**: `demo_dashboard` A simple dashboard of predictions vs actuals
- **App**: `demo-app` A streamlit app to simulate Fe and Si output based on Plant set levels + infeed
- **Pipeline**: `Mining Iron Ore Processing DLT Pipeline` a pipeline to ingest and transform our features
